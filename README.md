# RBF-network
Implemented an RBF network for one input variable, 
one output variable and Gaussian basis functions. 
The function we wanted to estimate is  h(x) = 0.5 + 0.4sin(2Ï€x). 
We want to vary the number of hidden layers and learning rate for the network 
to see how theses two factors influence the performance of the layer.
